# preProcess.ipynb

This notebook was utilized to work with and visualize the methods created in both posts.py and comDefs.py

  * Data folder found within J.work contains the original csv files used in our analysis. Our goal was to link the users to each post type to illustrate the changes in response over time. It was found that the data was highly skewed and did not accurately encompass the set, thus a random sample was produced for each response type and saved within files found in J.work/Data2.
